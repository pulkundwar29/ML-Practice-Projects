# ML Practice Projects

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **IMD Data of Mumbai**: This part of the project involves analyzing meteorological data from Mumbai using various machine learning models, including TensorFlow and Random Forest Regressor. The data is processed and visualized to understand weather patterns and make predictions.

2. **Titanic Prediction Model**: This component focuses on building a prediction model for the Titanic dataset using a Decision Tree Classifier. The model predicts the survival of passengers based on features such as age, class, and fare.

3. **CarsClassify**: This is a basic car classifier, distinguishing a car image based on its brand. It has images of cars from brands like Audi, Hyundai, Mahindra, Toyota, etc.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in a Jupyter environment.
2. Run the cells sequentially to process the data and build the models.
3. Visualize the results and predictions using the provided plots.
